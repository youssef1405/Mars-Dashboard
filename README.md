# Mars Dashboard - Functional Programming with Javascript

# Project Summary

A Mars rover dashboard that consumes the NASA API. The dashboard will allow the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission. The app will make use of the functional concepts and practices , and the goal is to be comfortable using pure functions and iterating over, reshaping, and accessing information from complex API responses.
